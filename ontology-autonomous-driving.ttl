    fibo:explanatoryNote "Only ADS-equipped vehicles capable of driverless operation (namely, an ADS-DV or a dual-mode vehicle) are potentially subject to being dispatched."@en,
        "The term “dispatch” as used outside of the context of ADS-equipped vehicles, is generally understood to mean sending a particular vehicle to a particular pick-up or drop-off location for purposes of providing a transportation service. In the context of ADS-equipped vehicles, and as used herein, this term includes software-enabled dispatch of multiple ADS-equipped vehicles in driverless operation that may complete multiple trips involving pick-up and drop-off of passengers or goods throughout a day or other pre-defined period of service, and which may involve multiple agents performing various tasks related to the dispatch function. In order to highlight this specialized use of the term dispatch, the term is modified and conditioned by the stipulation that it refers exclusively to dispatching vehicles in driverless operation. Consideration of whether a more appropriate term and definition should be specified for this concept will be taken up in the next revision of J3016, which will be developed jointly with ISO."@en .
